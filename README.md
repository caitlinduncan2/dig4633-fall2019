As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## VR Lab: Lab #1 

For Lab 1, I decided to add corn and a basket for my two interactable objects. First, the prompt tells the player to find the basket (which I put by the barn). After placing the basket on the table next to the corn stalks, the player then must pick the corn and place into the basket. After 4 corn has been placed in the basket, a prompt shows up. (The Lab is under wk1 tab, names JumpStart)

Rumpelstiltskin

## AR Lab: Lab #2

For Lab 2, I created a Unity3D project with Vuforia enabled that uses marker tracking to place a variety of fruits on a surface. Once the fruit models are on the surface, the user can move the marker and the models will move with it. The potential app that can grow from this protoype will be an AR game this is similar to Fruit Ninja, where the player can interact with the fruit, but in AR.
