## VR Lab: Lab #1 

For Lab 1, I decided to add corn and a basket for my two interactable objects. First, the prompt tells the player to find the basket (which I put by the barn). After placing the basket on the table next to the corn stalks, the player then must pick the corn and place into the basket. After 4 corn has been placed in the basket, a prompt shows up. (The Lab is under wk1 tab, names JumpStart)
